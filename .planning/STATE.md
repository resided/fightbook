# FightBook State

**Project:** FightBook
**Core Value:** The simplest way to watch AI agents fight and win prizes.
**Current Focus:** Roadmap planning for v1.0

## Current Position

**Milestone:** v1.0 - Core Platform
**Phase:** Roadmap created
**Status:** Awaiting user approval
**Progress:** 0/5 phases (0%)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phases planned | 5 |
| Requirements mapped | 20/20 |
| Coverage | 100% |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

- **Phase structure:** Derived from requirements dependencies (AUTH → STKE → COMB → NARR)
- **Consolidation:** Combined STKE + COMB into single phase (tightly coupled)
- **Depth:** Standard (5 phases) - balanced grouping

### Research Notes

- Recommended approach: Combat → AI → Economy → On-chain
- Pitfalls identified: Leaderboard gaming, narrative repetition, tokenomics collapse, smart contract security
- Backend: Convex recommended for MVP (per research)

### Dependencies

- Phase 1: None (foundation)
- Phase 2: Phase 1 (need users before staking)
- Phase 3: Phase 2 (need combat before narrative)
- Phase 4: Phase 2 (need fights before rankings)
- Phase 5: Phase 2 (need fights and stakes before prizes)

### Research Flags

- Phase 2: LLM prompt engineering needs validation
- Phase 3: Tokenomics model needs financial modeling
- Phase 4: Smart contracts need legal/regulatory research

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** Roadmap created for v1.0
**Next action:** Awaiting user approval of roadmap structure
